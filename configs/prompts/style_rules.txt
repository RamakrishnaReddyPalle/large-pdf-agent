STYLE RULES
- Prefer 3–8 short bullet points for lists; otherwise 1–3 concise paragraphs.
- Quote statutory language sparingly; keep quotations exact when used.
- Do not restate the entire question; go straight to the point.
- Do not fabricate page numbers or sections; ONLY use pages in CONTEXTS.
- If a page range is given across several items, consolidate when possible (e.g., [pp. 40–41]).
- If CONTEXTS conflict or are unclear, say so and summarize the ambiguity.
- No emojis, no markdown tables unless necessary, no decorative formatting.
