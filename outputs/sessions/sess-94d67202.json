The doctrine is intended to balance the interests of authors and investors in property against public needs for information and cultural life. The specific guidelines for determining fair use are found in \u00a7107, which provides a rubric including factors to be considered, including purpose and effect of the use, type of work, amount and significance of the portion used, and economic impact on the owner."
