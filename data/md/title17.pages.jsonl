Without these interim extensions, \ncopyrights commencing during that time period would have otherwise expired after 56 years, \nat the end of their renewal terms, between September 19, 1962, and December 31, 1976.

An article which nor-\nmally is part of a useful article shall be deemed to be a useful article.\n(3) A “vessel” is a craft—\n(A) that is designed and capable of independently steering a course on \nor through water through its own means of propulsion; and\n(B) that is designed and capable of carrying and transporting one or \nmore passengers.\n(4) A “hull” is the exterior frame or body of a vessel, exclusive of the deck, \nsuperstructure, masts, sails, yards, rigging, hardware, fixtures, and other \nattachments.\n(5) A “plug” means a device or model used to make a mold for the purpose \nof exact duplication, regardless of whether the device or model has an intrinsic \nutilitarian function that is not only to portray the appearance of the product \nor to convey information.\n(6) A “mold” means a matrix or form in which a substance for material \nis used, regardless of whether the matrix or form has an intrinsic utilitarian \nfunction that is not only to portray the appearance of the product or to convey \ninformation.\n"}
